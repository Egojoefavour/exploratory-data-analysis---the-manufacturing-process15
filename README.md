# exploratory-data-analysis---the-manufacturing-process15

## project status
This project is almost on the complete stage

### Project description

This project is all about optimisation of a manufacturing machine process for a large industrial company. The manufacturing process is a crucial aspect of the company's operations, and the optimisation of the process has a significant impact on the organisation's overall efficiency and profitability.

We will use statistical and visualisation techniques to explore the data and draw meaningful insights. The aim of the  analysis is to provide a better understanding of the manufacturing process as well as  help the business optimise the manufacturing process to reduce waste and maximise output.

The data contains information about 10k sessions of the machinery producing products. Additionally information about the machines state while producing the goods and whether/why it failed are included.

Overall, this project will showcase the power of exploratory data analysis in uncovering valuable insights from large datasets and how insights can be leveraged to drive business success.
